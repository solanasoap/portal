## Animations - 3
There's no niceness in the portal. Needs some animations.

## Maker - 2
A tool for anyone to create soaps permissionlessly and set up a soap dealer in a self-service way.

## Glow support - 1
Glow should be supported as well through whatever method in the browser.

## Guardrails against abuse - 4
Api, or minting. A user should only get one soap.

# DONE
## Gallery - 4
See all the soaps you own in one place.
## Dealer - 4
A way of distributing soaps. Eg. a QR code or link that people get a soap with.
## Solflare support - 3
Solflare is implementing deeplinks into their application, and it will use the same API schema as Phantom's.
The portal should have the button ready to go live before Solflare's update.
